Assessment Task
Objective: Build a simple page for managing a To-Do List using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Instructions:
Create a simple HTML page with
A header of "To-Do List"
An input field where users can type in a new task.
A button to add the task to the list.
A list that displays the tasks.
Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed and a delete button to remove the task.
Style the page
Style the page however you like, keeping the layout responsive.
Take accessibility into consideration
Add Functionality
When the user types in the input field and clicks the "Add" button, the task should be added to the list.
If the input field is empty and the user clicks "Add", show an error message saying "Please enter a task".
When a task's checkbox is clicked, the task should be marked as completed (e.g., apply a line-through style).
Each task should have a "Delete" button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.


Additional Features (Optional but encouraged):

Task Persistence: Use localStorage to save the list of tasks so that when the page is reloaded, the tasks persist.
Task Filtering: Allow users to filter tasks by "All", "Active", or "Completed" status.

Submission Requirements:
Provide a link to the GitHub repository containing your solution (or a ZIP file with the project).

Include a brief explanation of your approach, including any challenges faced or improvements you would add in the future.
